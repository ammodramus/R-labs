- matrices (and arrays)
- lists
- Data frames continued (data frame is like both matrix and list)
    - rows, columns
    - referring to columns by name
    - querying columns by type (?)
    - adding columns to data frame
    - dim()
    - attach(), detach()
    - logical operators & vs. && and | vs. || (also include if control flows, then?)
- lists
- t.tests (and transformation...work in qqplot()?)
    - q-q plot (have to introduce quantiles...)
- lm: plot regression with line
- more plotting... bar graphs? (with error bars?) boxplots? jitter? maybe on homework, one more-complicated graph? 
- How to write results? (report p-value, etc.)
- power simulations: too theoretical?

chisq.test()
prop.test()
t.test()
lm()
aov() (with caveats!)
